    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp. paprika</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>5 green chillies</li>
        <li>1 medium green bell pepper; chopped</li>
        <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
        <li>2 seasoning cubes</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. coconut oil</li>
        <li>1 medium sized onion; chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>1 tsp. chopped ginger</li>
        <li>2 tsp. ground crayfish</li>
        <li>2 large coconuts or 3 cups</li>
        <li>coconut milk</li>
        <li>3 cups long grain rice</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
    </ul><br>

    <h2>STEPS</h2> 
    <ol>
        <li>If you're using fresh coconuts, crack it open and separate the softer inner part from the hard shell using a small knife.</li>
        <li>Chop the coconuts into tiny bits and then put it in a blender with a few cups of warm water. Blend for about 6 mins.</li>
        <li>Pour the contents of the blender into a small sieve and drain the milk. Apply pressure to make sure you squeeze all the milk out. You can add more warm water to the coconut shaft and drain again.</li>
        <li>Next, parboil your rice by cooking for about 10 min., then take it off the cooker and run cold water through it. Repeat until the rice cools down. Now place in a colander and drain. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a pot and add coconut oil to help intensify the flavour. Add onion, chopped pepper, ginger, garlic and all the spices (except crayfish). Sauté for 5 mins.</li>
        Add your pre-made coconut milk and parboiled rice, and then add the chicken stock. Cook for 15 – 20 mins. Make sure you have enough coconut milk so that you can add more to the rice if it dries out.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is almost done, add the crayfish. Mix it together and allow to simmer.</li>
    </ol>
